GAME
<Br>
~ This Python code is a number guessing game. 
<BR>
~ The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. 
<Br>
~ The user then tries to guess the number, receiving hints to guess either higher or lower. 
<Br>
~ The game continues until the correct number is guessed, and the program displays the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
