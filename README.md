# GAME
- This Python code is a number guessing game. 
- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. 
- The user then tries to guess the number, receiving hints to guess either higher or lower. 
- The game continues until the correct number is guessed, and the program displays the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.

  --- Fun playing! ---
